# Three-Body-Problem

In this project, I use the Runge-Kutta Method to solve a three-body problem. Namely, I include a third moon, of about half mass of the actual moon, initialize a set of given initial conditions, and try to determine whether or not the system is stable, or will eventually collapse (one of the objects collides with another).
