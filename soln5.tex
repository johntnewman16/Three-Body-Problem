\underline{\bf \large Homework 5: Three Body Problem}
\end{center}

In this homework, we first practice the implementation of the fifth order Runge-Kutta method with automatic step sizing as outlined in $\textit{Numerical Recipes}$ [1], and then proceed to use it in order to observe the behavior of a hypothetical 3-body problem in which another moon is added to Earth's orbit. First, we start off with the 5th/4th order solution as outlined in section 17.2 of \textit{Numerical Recipes}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{aligned}
&y_{n+1} = y_{n} + b_1k_1 + b_2k_2 +b_3k_3 + b_4k_4 + b_5k_5 +b_6k_6 + O(h)^6\\
&y_{n+1}^* = y_{n} + b^*_1k_1 + b^*_2k_2 +b^*_3k_3 + b^*_4k_4 + b^*_5k_5 +b^*_6k_6 + b^*_7y_{n+1}O(h)^5\\
&k_1 = hf(x_n, y_n)\\
&k_2 = hf(x_n + c_2h, y_n + a_{21}k_1\\
...\\
&k_6 = hf(x_n + c_6h, y_n + a_{61}k_1 + ... + a_{65}k_5)\\
\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray}
In order to implement this method, I started by allocating enough space for each of the 8 arrays that are used later on in the method (k1-k7 and temp), each of which have a length of neqns, which represents the number of equations in the system. When calculating each k, I use temp to store the value that is evaluated by the system, and then store those values in k. Since every value in the array of each k depends on the values of the array of the previous k, it is necessary to do a complete for-loop for each of them in order to later evaluate $y_{n+1}$. Finally, once the routine returns all of the values, I then delete k1 in order to allow the program to dynamically allocate the next set of k values.\\

The auto-step size Runge-Kutta routine departs from the regular Runge-Kutta routine at this point, since once I have acquired $y_{n+1}$, I then use this value, which corresponds to a 5th order approximation, in order to calculate the 4th order approximation, $y^*_{n+1}$. Finding the maximum of such error, and then using an appropriate scale to find what $\textit{Numerical Recipes}$ [1] refers to as the "worst offender", or the value for which the two approximations differ the most. We then take this value to reevaluate an appropriate h to be used in the next iteration of the Runge-Kutta, as specified by the equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{aligned}
&h_0 = h_1|\frac{err_0}{err_1}|^{1/5}\\
&err_1 = max\frac{|y_{n+1} - y^*_{n+1}|}{scale}
\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray}
where $err_0$ is the tolerable error, and $err_1$ is the maximum value of the difference between the two methods divided by a scale, as shown in the equation above.
Using this subroutine, I then plug in the system of equations, along with its initial conditions. As a test case, my first system of differential equations was that of a sinusoidal function:

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + \omega^2y = 0
\end{eqnarray}

Setting the initial conditions to $y(t=0)=1$ and $yâ€²(t = 0)=0$, we expect this set of equations to yield a cosine function after using it as an argument in the ODE solver. The figure below matches this prediction (amplitude = 1, period = 2$\pi$):

\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{harmonic.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Cosine Function evaluated by ODE autostep solver}
\label{fbigh}
\end{figure}

\newpage

After establishing that the ODE solver was working, I then moved on to the Three-Body system, as defined by the equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{dx_i}{dt} = v_i\\
&\frac{dv_i}{dt} = G\sum_{j\neq i}m_j\frac{x_j - x_i}{|x_j - x_i|^3}
\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray}
where G is the gravitational constant, $m_j$ is the mass of object j, and the summation of j$\neq$i represents the acceleration contribution of each object j on object i.
Using the initial conditions specified in the homework, minus the influence of the second moon, with a starting h step size of 1000, and a tolerance of 10E-08, I was able to generate the following graph for the predicted orbit of the Earth and Moon:
\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{nomass.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Initial Orbit Attempt. The blue line is the Moon and the black line is the Earth}
\label{fbigh}
\end{figure}

The stability of these orbits demonstrate an agreement with the normal behavior of the Earth and Moon, indicating that the method is working. In the following table, I list the behavior of h as the method goes along:
\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\begin{tabular}{ c c }
h (seconds)	&	t (days)	\\
10408.7	&	0	\\
2847.3	&	25	\\
10855.4	&	50	\\
10412.2	&	75	\\
11224.8	&	100	\\
11029.6	&	125	\\
10415.4	&	150	\\
11344.9	&	175	\\
10922.9	&	200	\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Observing the progression of h with t}
\label{fbigh}
\end{figure}

In the region from about 20 days to 30 days in the orbit, the step size of the function drops to around 3000 seconds, noting that the auto-step size method had difficulty navigating this region, and thus narrowed down the step size to accurately explore it. Thus, if we were to do a regular Runge-Kutta method, we would have to choose a step size of around h = 2000 in order to ensure the disruption of this region did not influence the rest of the behavior of the system; a step size which is 5 times less than the stable values of about h = 10000 that the rest of the system exhibited. This in turn allows us to save a lot of time, by progressing through the problem quickly, without sacrificing stability and accuracy.\\

After completing this example, I then went on to the Three-Body system, introducing a third moon whose mass was about half that of Earth's actual moon.
\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{withmass.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Three Body Orbit. The blue line is the Moon, the black line is the Earth, and the green line is a hypothetical third Moon}
\label{fbigh}
\end{figure}

This graph demonstrates a notably different behavior from the two body figure in the previous problem. Unlike the stable orbit of the Earth and the Moon, it appears that the second moon is starting to wrap in closer and closer to the Earth. In fact, zooming in closer to the Earth, we see a very notable drift in the positive x-direction:
\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{drift.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Earth Drift as a result of the second moon}
\label{fbigh}
\end{figure}

Taking the time span to be even greater, I even found that a collision between the second moon and the Earth would occur within about 500 days. This indicates that the initial conditions on the second moon made it so that it did not have enough energy in its orbit to maintain its elliptical path about the Earth.
\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{collision.png}
\end{center}
\caption{The Second Moon collapsing into the Earth at t = 503 days}
\label{fbigh}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\begin{tabular}{ c c }
h (seconds)	&	t (days)	\\
10394.2	&	0	\\
5956.77	&	25	\\
10871.6	&	50	\\
11342.5	&	75	\\
6675.57	&	100	\\
12472.7	&	125	\\
4771.71	&	150	\\
10991.1	&	175	\\
4220.13	&	200	\\
12919.3	&	300	\\
6742.11	&	400	\\
242.408	&	500	\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Observing the progression of h with t}
\label{fbigh}
\end{figure}

The h-behavior in this Three Body system is very different from that of the two body system. Most notably, right near the time of the collision, the h-step size goes down rapidly, as the autostep system struggles to cope with the enormous gravitational force the two celestial bodies exert on one another as they get closer and closer. During the regions while they maintain some semblance of an orbit however, the h values are comparable, if not sometimes greater than that of the two body problem. However, they fluctuate to lower values more often, at the times when the second body becomes close to the Earth, causing the autostep function to refine its step size to better analyze these regions.

\newpage


Optional 1: Since it was apparent that given the initial conditions of this problem, the second moon did not have enough energy to maintain its orbit, I decided to change the initial conditions to see if I could maintain its orbit for at least 1000 days. By increasing its inital (x,y) velocity to (800, 500) m/s, I was able to make it maintain a suitable orbit for 1000 days without causing a collision. However, the earth in this system still began to drift, now with an additional y velocity, as shown in the graph below:

\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\includegraphics[scale=0.37]{nocollision.png}
\end{center}
\caption{"Fixed" Three Body Problem. No collision at t = 1000 days, though Earth still drifts, now with a small +y component.}
\label{fbigh}
\end{figure}

This behavior indicates just how precarious the orbits of a system can be, and how extraordinary it is that we managed to end up in such a stable gravitational system.
